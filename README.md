xTeam174-Airport-System

The complex system of organizing departure and arrival of flights between airports, for each passenger.
Every airport has a system to integrate the information about airlines, flights, airport networks, departures, arrivals, etc. 
This program is aimed to help establish a database to collect all related data and share it to the public.
Also airport managers are permitted to revise the data(add/remove/â€¦).
